I'm Saurabh. I'm a computer science graduate student at California State University, Fullerton.

The repository that I'm working on the most are [Spring Boot][1] and [Reddit Backend][2]. 

In the Spring Boot project, I'm trying to understand how a modern Java microservice application works. My focus in on RESTful API development & testing using spring microservices.

In the Reddit Backend project, I'm [revisiting the project][3] for a course I was enrolled in, during Spring 2020. See whats new [here][2].

Serious projects (pinned) contain remote build environments like Travis CI and CircleCI, as well as complete coverage for souce code and test cases.

You can [email me](mailto:saurab.mish@gmail.com), or find me on:
