I'm Saurabh. I'm a computer science graduate student at California State University, Fullerton.

The repositories that I'm working on the most are:
1. [Reddit Backend][1]

    + I'm [revisiting the group project][4] for a course I was enrolled in, during Spring 2020. 
    + See whats new [here][1].

2. [Microblog][2]

    + Full-stack web application using Python's Django microservices.

3. [Car Inventory][3]

    + API development using Java's Spring microservices with TDD approach.
    + This is the right project to get started with test-driven development because Java is enterprise-y!

You can also find me on:

+ [LinkedIn][5]

+ [StackExchange][6]
